              I am a professional photographer who focuses on capturing precious moments and transforming them into meaningful visual artworks. With over 5 years of experience, I have worked on various projects ranging from pre-wedding, portrait, product, to commercial photography. For me, every photo is not just an image, but a story that needs to be told and preserved.
